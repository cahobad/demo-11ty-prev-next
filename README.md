## Important Parts to Understand

### Running Nunjucks code in Markdown (.md) files

```js
.eleventy.js

markdownTemplateEngine : "njk"
```

Setting the Template Engine for markdown (.md) files allows us to run Nunjucks code in our `/src/index.md` file so we can loop through the **Covers & Posts Collections** to create the links to those entries.

---

### Automatic Collections

We don't have to specify Collections in the `.eleventy.js` file for something as simple as this demo.

`/src/covers/covers.json` setting `tags: covers` automatically creates the "covers" Collections.  
And tells 11ty to use the `/src/_includes/layouts/cover.njk` template for every Entry so we don't have to set that Frontmatter in each content .md file.

`/src/posts/posts.json` setting `tags: posts` automatically creates the "posts" Collections.  
And tells 11ty to use the `/src/_includes/layouts/post.njk` template for every Entry so we don't have to set that Frontmatter in each content .md file.

We can then loop through the "covers" and "posts" Collections in `/src/index.md` and generate links to the Covers and Posts entries.

---

### Generating Previous and Next links in the Entry Details

Now in `/src/_includes/layouts/cover.njk` and `/src/_includes/layouts/post.njk` we can set `previousPost` and `nextPost` variables using 11ty's built in Filters: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/collection-items/

- getPreviousCollectionItem(page)
- getNextCollectionItem(page)

```liquid
/src/_includes/layouts/cover.njk

{% set previousPost = collections.covers | getPreviousCollectionItem(page) %}
{% set nextPost = collections.covers | getNextCollectionItem(page) %}
```

```liquid
/src/_includes/layouts/post.njk

{% set previousPost = collections.posts | getPreviousCollectionItem(page) %}
{% set nextPost = collections.posts | getNextCollectionItem(page) %}
```

Then use simple conditionals to display (or not) the Previous and Next links:

```liquid
/src/_includes/layouts/post.njk

    <div>
      {% if previousPost %}
        <p><a href="{{ previousPost.url }}">← {{ previousPost.data.title }}</a></p>
      {% endif %}
    </div>

    <div>
      {% if nextPost %}
        <a href="{{ nextPost.url }}">{{ nextPost.data.title }} →</a>
      {% endif %}
    </div>
```
